# A hitchhikers guide to data science
This is a list of topics I covered or willing to cover while Im reading about data science. Since I lose my track most of the time it only makes sense if I keep uploading things to github and constantly keep what I read and share it in the process of course. Need I remind you this list is unordered. I might do a proper ordered list later. My target production backend is based on Apache Spark and I'm felxible with a C#, python or F# tech stack. It's intentionally production goal oriented since I like to learn that way and recursively fill up what I am missing. :)
